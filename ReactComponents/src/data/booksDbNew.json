It is also the day my husband left me...I can only assume the two events weren't entirely unrelated. Claire has everything she ever wanted: a husband she adores, a great apartment, a good job. Then, on the day she gives birth to their first baby, James informs her that he's leaving her. Claire is left with a newborn daughter, a broken heart, and a postpartum body that she can hardly bear to look at. She decides to go home to Dublin. And there, sheltered by the love of a quirky family, she gets better. So much so, in fact, that when James slithers back into her life, he's in for a bit of a surprise.",

              "description": "Learn to bake with Britain's favourite women's fiction author Marian Keyes, in her startlingly honest cook-book Saved by Cake. Saved by Cake gives an extremely honest account of Marian Keyes' battle with depression, and how baking has helped her. A complete novice in the kitchen, Marian decided to bake a cake for a friend and that was it - she realised that baking was what she needed to do in order to get her through each day. And so she baked, and she wrote her recipes down, and little by little the depression started to lift, along with her sponges... With chapters on cupcakes, cheesecakes, meringues and macaroons, chocolate cakes, fruit cakes and favourite classics, Marian's recipes are aimed firmly at beginner bakers, offering hints and tips to help along the way. From her Consistently Reliable Cupcakes and Very Chocolately Macaroons, to the ease of her Fridge-set Honeycomb Cheesecake, you will want to have a go at making all of Marian's recipes. The shoe and handbag biscuits particularly. Very covetable. Very Marian. Never patronising, always honest and witty, accessible and full of fun, the bakes and cakes that Marian serves up in this cookbook will put a smile on your face and make you happy. __________ 'Medically speaking, there is no such thing as a nervous breakdown. Which is very annoying to discover when you're right in the middle of one. Whatever was going on with me, I had to wait it out. I had to find ways of passing the time until I was restored to myself again. So I baked a cake - a chocolate cheesecake, as it happens. And I enjoyed making it so much that I baked another. And another' Marian Keyes",

But as Sammy and her friends sneak up to the spookiest house in town, they get scared witless by a skeleton, and then witness something frightening enough to make even Sammy scream. Things have taken a scary turn at school, too, with horrible Heather spreading embarrassing rumors about Sammy. Sammy devises a plan to expose her, but it's going to take a deceptive disguise, some good friends, and a lot of guts to pull it off...

A top-notch investigator!” —New York Times bestselling author Sue Grafton “The sleuth delights from start to finish.

Neo-truth. Soft truth. Faux truth. Truth lite.\" Deception has become the modern way of life. Where once the boundary line between truth and lies was clear and distinct, it is no longer so. In the post-truth era, deceiving others has become a challenge, a game, a habit. High-profile dissemblers compete for news coverage, from journalists like Jayson Blair and professors like Joseph Ellis to politicians (of all stripes), executives, and \"creative\" accountants. Research suggests that the average American tells multiple lies on a daily basis, often for no good reason. Not a finger-wagging scolding, The Post-Truth Era is a combination of Ralph Keyes's investigative journalism and solid science. The result is a spirited exploration of why we lie about practically everything and the consequences such casual dishonesty has on society. American society has become permeated from top to bottom by deception. Its consequences for the nature of public discourse, media, business, literature, academia, and politics are profound. With dry humor, passionate fervor, and deep understanding, Ralph Keyes takes us on a tour of a world where truth and honesty are no longer absolutes but mutable, fluid concepts.",

На нього чекає курс лікування у психіатричній клініці для злочинців у Лімі. Це місце вважалося справдешнім пеклом на землі. Те, що коїли з пацієнтами у цих стінах, мало залишатися моторошною таємницею. І побиття та щоденні знущання було далеко не найжахливішим з того, що чекало тут на Біллі. Але він не такий, як інші хворі. Він має 24 особистості та безмежну волю до життя. У голові Біллі точаться запеклі війни, і його намагатимуться знищити, не розуміючи, що мають справу не з ним одним… Яка боротьба буде простішою — із системою чи із самим собою?",

She imagined shady glades, meandering streams, a deer or two. What she gets are scrubby shrubs, blazing sun, rattlesnakes, ticks, and scorpions. Her fellow campers are desperate to catch a rare glimpse of an endangered condor. To Sammy, the trip is nothing more than the painful in pursuit of the unspeakably ugly. But when she and two other girls find an injured condor, Sammy's intrigued at last. As they track down a clue, they stumble onto two classmates and wind up lost. Which leaves three girls and two boys in a canyon with one tent and six billion biting flies. Oh—and an armed and dangerous highstakes poacher. S'mores anyone? The Sammy Keyes mysteries are fast-paced, funny, thoroughly modern, and true whodunits. Each mystery is exciting and dramatic, but it's the drama in Sammy's personal life that keeps readers coming back to see what happens next with her love interest Casey, her soap-star mother, and her mysterious father.",

She decides, for the first time in her life, to do something daring -- and flees to her best friend, Emily, in the faraway wonderland of Los Angeles. In this mecca of tanned, beautiful bodies, unsvelte, uncool Maggie is decidedly a fish out of water. Yet, overnight, she's mixing with film folk, pitching scripts, even experimenting with sex -- and discovering that the end of a marriage is not the end of the world.",

But for four women in particular, the big news about the charismatic politician is especially momentous. Stylist Lola has every reason to be interested in who Paddy's marrying--because she's his girlfriend, yet she definitely isn't the bride-to-be. Journalist Grace wants the inside story on the de Courcy engagement and thinks Lola holds the key, while Grace's sister, Marnie, still can't forget her first love: a certain Paddy de Courcy. And what of the soon-to-be Mrs de Courcy? Alicia will do anything for her fiance and is determined to be the perfect wife. But does she know the real Paddy? Four very different women. One awfully charming man. And the dark secret that binds them all.",

Sample Book Insights: #1 When Marilyn Pindar did not come home on Sunday night, her sister, Sheila, was alarmed. She and a couple of friends had dropped by the apartment a little after 7:30 the previous evening, to find her sister out, and after waiting a few minutes, had left. They had not heard from Marilyn since. #2 The typical missing persons case is some restless student taking off on a lark. In such environments, the police are usually hard pressed to find anything suspicious. #3 Following her disappearance, the Pindars showed themselves to be people of extraordinary self-possession. They remained on the surface unruffled. The father returned to his job, the mother to her normal household routine. #4 The Marilyn Pindar case was opened up on July 11, when Detective Lieutenant Vern Howard was assigned to it. He pieced together a timeline of her last known movements on Sunday, July 9, the day she went missing. She went to church, then to the university, and finally to Silver Lake.",

Your side, their side, and the truth . . .' Jojo, a sharkish literary agent, has just made a very bad career move - she's slept with her married boss Mark. Lily, Jojo's bestselling author, has blown her advance on a house with new boyfriend Anton, only to come down with writer's block. Gemma used to be Lily's best friend until Lily ran off with Anton. Now she's pouring her heart out, and a certain literary agent likes her style . . . Soon the fortunes of Jojo, Lily and Gemma are horribly entangled. But each is about to discover that there's more than one side to every story . . . ___________ 'Keyes's genius lies in making the darkest, most difficult aspects of humanity mentionable and manageable . . .
